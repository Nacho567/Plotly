Module 13: Plotly &amp; Belly Button Biodiversity

## ***Overview***

A Github I/O page was created [here](https://nacho567.github.io/Plotly/ "Link to IO page").

In this project we helped finish a dashboard displaying multiple charts of belly button bacteria. We drew on json data, threw it into some JS, created a a webpage with HTML, and finally styled it with some CSS. As you select a test subject, the information for all charts changes with it. One issue still troubling my code is that every time I try to put the 'charts.js' file in the correct folder (static/js) it breaks the fetch request.
